# Syntax
## Differences from lisp 
* '<' and '>' instead of '(' and ')'
* '<@ i 10>' sets i to 10
* '<@F foo <f> <* f f>' is a function
* '<foo 1>' is calling that function
* '<@case <= 1 1> 1 <+ 1 2>>' is a case
* '<@while <lt i 10> <@ i <+ i 1>>>' is a while loop
### Lists ###
* Lists are just blocks of code which are not yet executed. so, lists are parts of asts
```python
* '`<1 2 3 4>' is a list
* '<: `<1 2 3 4> 1>' gives 2, ':' is indexing operator
* '<# `<1 2>>' gives 2, '#' is length operator
* '<:/ `<1 2 3 4> 1 2>' gives `<2 3>, :/ is a slicing operator
```

## Using the command line
* print <expr> prints the AST
* time <expr> runs and prints the time taken
* load file_name load that file_name 

# How to run ? 

## Interactive
 ```bash
 python limps.py 
 ```
## With File
